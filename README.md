dwmstatus
============

Fork off ctgrl/go-dwmstatus that doesn't require any external libraries.
Displays current mpd song, volume, date and time, and the current battery level.

If you do not have a battery it will currently output No battery. Because it use it on my laptop. If you want to remove it it should be pretty simple to fix in the code.
